It's battleship, but you only have one ship, and some decoys! It's not pretty but it works

# How to play
Setup your ship: You make one ship that has to be made of 2 to 10 adjacent tiles, you can give it the shape you want as long as it's all connected (no diagonals)
Decoys: If you click again on a ship tile, it will turn into a decoy, click again to cycle through the decoys and eventually delete the tile. You can use as many decoys as you like, but we suggest you establish limits with your opponent (two or three of each is good).
One you are ready, click the ready button and wait for the other player. The text in the upper left corner tells you which player you are and, below, whose turn it is.

The reset button resets the whole thing for both players. Refreshing a page will do the same.
